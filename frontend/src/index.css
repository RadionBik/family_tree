/*
  All global styles previously here are now handled by MUI's CssBaseline
  component (applied in main.jsx) and the theme configuration (theme.js).
  Individual component styling is done using MUI components and the `sx` prop
  or `styled` utility.

  This file is kept primarily because it's imported in main.jsx,
  but its content is no longer needed for the MUI-based public site.
  Admin-specific global styles (if any) should go elsewhere or be scoped properly.
